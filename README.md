## Loan Status Prediction
- This project predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not based on various features using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.

## Steps Performed

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - ✅ Handled missing values, ensuring the dataset is consistent and ready for analysis.

2. **Data Visualization**  
   - 📊 Explored relationships between various features and loan status using visualizations:  
     - **Education and Loan Status**: The number of loans approved for graduates is higher compared to non-graduates.  
     - **Marital Status and Loan Status**: Married individuals have a higher loan approval rate compared to unmarried individuals.

3. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - 🔄 Prepared the data by encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features to ensure compatibility with the model.

4. **Splitting the Dataset**  
   - 📂 Divided the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance effectively.

5. **Model Training and Testing**  
   - 🤖 Used the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model with a linear kernel for classification.  
   - 🎯 Achieved an **accuracy score of 80%** on the test dataset.
